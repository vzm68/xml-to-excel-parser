# xml-to-excel-parser
Some code notes for my future project improve. This code help me to get XML data to Excel tables. And vice versa.

In the XML template, there is an example of one offer that you can work with for a test and understand the structure that I am working with in this example.

As a first step, I prepare an XML file to parse the required content in Excel, run to_excel.py to apply some changes in the new file, and run from_excel.py to get the new XML file.
